# Sentiment Analysis of the PLN Mobile Application

**Proposed Research:**
The urgency of sentiment analysis for the PLN Mobile application lies in the need to understand customer perceptions of the app. Positive sentiment reflects a high level of satisfaction, encouraging users to continue using the application. Conversely, negative sentiment indicates issues and dissatisfaction that require immediate attention (Gupta et al., 2020).
Through sentiment analysis, PLN can gain valuable insights into aspects of the application that need improvement, such as transaction efficiency, customer service responsiveness, and ease of navigation. These insights enable PLN to enhance user experience, address concerns proactively, and improve overall service quality, ultimately increasing customer retention and engagement.

## What is our conclusion?

1. Follow-Up Actions on Topic Modeling for PLN:
- Promoting the live chat feature as an alternative communication channel between customers and PLN disturbance service officers
- Adding an FAQ section with animated tutorial guides on the homepage.
- Introducing short movies in PLN Mobile as customer guidance for troubleshooting application issues.

2. Based on the word cloud results, the most frequently occurring words include PLN, mobile, features, complaints, application, chat, live, and others. Therefore, management needs to pay close attention to these high-frequency words, as they indicate critical aspects that should be considered when formulating strategies to enhance the quality of the applicationâ€™s services in the future. Based on the neural network results, management needs to pay attention to central words, supporting words, and clustered words as critical points in determining the future quality of service.

3. From the Test and Score results using Logistic Regression, Neural Network, SVM, and Tree, the model that produced the most accurate predictions was the Neural Network with an accuracy of over 96%. Therefore, further model development is recommended to utilize and optimize Neural Network techniques for improved predictive performance.
